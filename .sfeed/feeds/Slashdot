Variety reports: Santa Clarita resident Ryan Mitchell Kramer, 25, pleaded guilty to two felony charges, including one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison. According to the plea agreement, in early 2024 Kramer posted a computer program on various online platforms that appeared to be used to create AI-generated art, when it really contained a malicious file to gain access to victims' computers.\n \nBetween April and May 2024, a Disney employee downloaded the program, and Kramer gained access to the victim's personal and work accounts, including a non-public Disney Slack channel. Kramer dowloaded approximately 1.1 terabytes of confidential data from thousands of Disney Slack channels. In July, Kramer contacted the victim by pretending to be a member of a fake Russian hacktivist group called "Nullbulge" and threatened to leak their personal information and Disney Slack data. On July 12, Kramer publicly released the data, including the victim's bank, medical, and personal information on multiple online platforms.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Man+Pleads+Guilty+To+Stealing+1.1+Terabytes+of+Disney's+Slack+Data+%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F03%2F0126234%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F03%2F0126234%2Fman-pleads-guilty-to-stealing-11-terabytes-of-disneys-slack-data%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/05/03/0126234/man-pleads-guilty-to-stealing-11-terabytes-of-disneys-slack-data?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681987&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1746255600	Evidence of Controversial Planet 9 Uncovered In Sky Surveys Taken 23 Years Apart	https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/05/03/0118242/evidence-of-controversial-planet-9-uncovered-in-sky-surveys-taken-23-years-apart?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Astronomers may have found the best candidate yet for the elusive Planet Nine: a mysterious object in infrared sky surveys taken 23 years apart that appears to be more massive than Neptune and about 700 times farther from the sun than Earth. Space.com reports: [A] team led by astronomer Terry Long Phan of the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan has delved into the archives of two far-infrared all-sky surveys in search of Planet Nine -- and incredibly, they have found something that could possibly be Planet Nine. The Infrared Astronomy Satellite, IRAS, launched in 1983 and surveyed the universe for almost a year before being decommissioned. Then, in 2006, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched AKARI, another infrared astronomy satellite that was active between 2006 and 2011. Phan's team were looking for objects that appeared in IRAS's database, then appeared to have moved by the time AKARI took a look. The amount of movement on the sky would be tiny -- about three arcminutes per year at a distance of approximately 700 astronomical units (AU). One arcminute is 1/60 of an angular degree.\n \nBut there's an extra motion that Phan's team had to account for. As the Earth orbits the sun, our view of the position of very distant objects changes slightly in an effect called parallax. It is the same phenomenon as when you hold your index finger up to your face, close one eye and look at your finger, and then switch eyes -- your finger appears to move as a result of you looking at it from a slightly different position. Planet Nine would appear to move on the sky because of parallax as Earth moves around the sun. On any particular day, it might seem to be in one position, then six months later when Earth is on the other side of the sun, it would shift to another position, perhaps by 10 to 15 arcminutes -- then, six months after that, it would seem to shift back to its original position. To remove the effects of parallax, Phan's team searched for Planet Nine on the same date every year in the AKARI data, because on any given date it would appear in the same place, with zero parallax shift, every year. They then also scrutinized each candidate object that their search threw up on an hourly basis. If a candidate is a fast-moving, nearby object, then its motion would be detectable from hour to hour, and could therefore be ruled out. This careful search led Phan's team to a single object, a tiny dot in the infrared data.\n \nIt appears in one position in IRAS's 1983 image, though it was not in that position when AKARI looked. However, there is an object seen by AKARI in a position 47.4 arcminutes away that isn't there in the IRAS imagery, and it is within the range that Planet Nine could have traveled in the intervening time. In other words, this object has moved a little further along its orbit around the sun in the 23 or more years between IRAS and AKARI. The knowledge of its motion in that intervening time is not sufficient to be able to extrapolate the object's full orbit, therefore it's not yet possible to say for certain whether this is Planet Nine. First, astronomers need to recover it in more up-to-date imagery. [...] Based on the candidate object's brightness in the IRAS and AKARI images, Phan estimates that the object, if it really is Planet Nine, must be more massive than Neptune. This came as a surprise, because he and his team were searching for a super-Earth-size body. Previous surveys by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have ruled out any Jupiter-size planets out to 256,000 AU, and any Saturn-size planets out to 10,000 AU, but a smaller Neptune or Uranus-size world could still have gone undetected. Phan told Space.com that he had searched for his candidate in the WISE data, "but no convincing counterpart was found because it has moved since the 2006 position," and without knowing its orbit more accurately, we can't say where it has moved to. \n"Once we know the position of the candidate, a longer exposure with the current large optical telescopes can detect it," Phan told Space.com. "However, the follow-up observations with optical telescopes still need to cover about three square degrees because Planet Nine would have moved from the position where AKARI detected it in 2006. This is doable with a camera that has a large field of view, such as the Dark Energy Camera, which has a field of view of three square degrees on the Blanco four-meter telescope [in Chile]."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Evidence+of+Controversial+Planet+9+Uncovered+In+Sky+Surveys+Taken+23+Years+Apart%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F03%2F0118242%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F03%2F0118242%2Fevidence-of-controversial-planet-9-uncovered-in-sky-surveys-taken-23-years-apart%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/05/03/0118242/evidence-of-controversial-planet-9-uncovered-in-sky-surveys-taken-23-years-apart?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681985&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1746243000	First Driverless Semis Have Started Running Regular Longhaul Routes	https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2258206/first-driverless-semis-have-started-running-regular-longhaul-routes?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNN: Driverless trucks are officially running their first regular long-haul routes, making roundtrips between Dallas and Houston. On Thursday, autonomous trucking firm Aurora announced it launched commercial service in Texas under its first customers, Uber Freight and Hirschbach Motor Lines, which delivers time- and temperature-sensitive freight. Both companies conducted test runs with Aurora, including safety drivers to monitor the self-driving technology dubbed "Aurora Driver." Aurora's new commercial service will no longer have safety drivers.\n \n"We founded Aurora to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly, said Chris Urmson, CEO and co-founder of Aurora, in a release on Thursday. "Now, we are the first company to successfully and safely operate a commercial driverless trucking service on public roads." The trucks are equipped with computers and sensors that can see the length of over four football fields. In four years of practice hauls the trucks' technology has delivered over 10,000 customer loads. As of Thursday, the company's self-driving tech has completed over 1,200 miles without a human in the truck. Aurora is starting with a single self-driving truck and plans to add more by the end of 2025.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=First+Driverless+Semis+Have+Started+Running+Regular+Longhaul+Routes%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2258206%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2258206%2Ffirst-driverless-semis-have-started-running-regular-longhaul-routes%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2258206/first-driverless-semis-have-started-running-regular-longhaul-routes?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681887&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1746233100	Microsoft Appoints Deputy CISO For Europe To Reassure European IT leaders	https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2251200/microsoft-appoints-deputy-ciso-for-europe-to-reassure-european-it-leaders?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Microsoft has appointed a Deputy CISO for Europe to address growing regulatory pressure and reassure EU leaders about its cybersecurity commitment. "The move also highlights strong fears from European IT execs and government officials that the Trump administration may exert significant influence on cybersecurity companies," reports CSO Online. From the report: Who that Deputy CISO will ultimately be is unclear. Wednesday's statement simply said that Microsoft CISO Igor Tsyganskiy is "appointing a new Deputy CISO for Europe as part of the Microsoft Cybersecurity Governance Council," but the phrasing made it unclear when that would happen. However, Tsyganskiy made a separate announcement on LinkedIn that he has given the role to current Deputy CISO Ann Johnson. But he then said that Johnson, who is based at Microsoft's head office in Redmond, Washington, will hold that post "temporarily."\n \nIn his LinkedIn post, Tsyganskiy explained that the Cybersecurity Governance Council, which was created in 2024, consists of "our Global CISO and Deputy Chief Information Security Officers (Deputy CISOs) representing each of our technology services. This Council oversees the company's cyber risks, defenses, and compliance across regions and domains." "The Deputy CISO for Europe will be accountable for compliance with current and emerging cybersecurity regulations in Europe, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), the NIS 2 Directive, and the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)," Tsyganskiy wrote. "These laws will prove transformative not only in EU markets, but worldwide, and Microsoft is actively engaged in preparing for what lies ahead." Microsoft said in Wednesday's statement: "the appointment of a Deputy CISO for Europe reflects the importance and global influence of EU cybersecurity regulations and the company's commitment to meeting and exceeding those expectations to prioritize cybersecurity across the region. This new position will report directly to Microsoft's CISO."\n \nMichela Menting, France-based digital security research director at ABI Research, said when she heard on Wednesday that Microsoft was creating such a role, "I was mostly surprised that they don't already have one."\n \n"GDPR has been in place for quite some time now and the fact they are only now putting in a European deputy CISO is concerning," Menting added. "They are playing catch up."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+Appoints+Deputy+CISO+For+Europe+To+Reassure+European+IT+leaders%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2251200%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2251200%2Fmicrosoft-appoints-deputy-ciso-for-europe-to-reassure-european-it-leaders%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2251200/microsoft-appoints-deputy-ciso-for-europe-to-reassure-european-it-leaders?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681869&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1746230520	US Asks Judge To Break Up Google's Ad Tech Business	https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2243229/us-asks-judge-to-break-up-googles-ad-tech-business?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	The U.S. government is seeking to break up Google's advertising technology business after a judge ruled the company holds an illegal monopoly over ad tools for publishers, marking the second such antitrust case following a similar request to divest Chrome. The Guardian reports: "We have a defendant who has found ways to defy" the law, US government lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told a federal court in Virginia, as she urged the judge to dismiss Google's assurance that it would change its behavior. "Leaving a recidivist monopolist" intact was not appropriate to solve the issue, she added. [...] The US government specifically alleged that Google controls the market for publishing banner ads on websites, including those of many creators and small news providers.\n \nThe hearing in a Virginia courtroom was scheduled to plan out the second phase of the trial, set for September, in which the parties will argue over how to fix the ad market to satisfy the judge's ruling. The plaintiffs argued in the first phase of the trial last year that the vast majority of websites use Google ad software products which, combined, leave no way for publishers to escape Google's advertising technology and pricing.\n \nThe district court judge Leonie Brinkema agreed with most of that reasoning, ruling last month that Google built an illegal monopoly over ad software and tools used by publishers, but partially dismissed the argument related to tools used by advertisers. The US government said it would use the trial to recommend that Google should spin off its ad publisher and exchange operations, as Google could not be trusted to change its ways. "Behavioral remedies are not sufficient because you can't prevent Google from finding a new way to dominate," Tarver Wood said.\n \nGoogle countered that it would recommend that it agree to a binding commitment that it would share information with advertisers and publishers on its ad tech platforms. Google lawyer Karen Dunn did, however, acknowledge the "trust issues" raised in the case and said the company would accept monitoring to guarantee any commitments made to satisfy the judge. Google is also arguing that calls for divestment are not appropriate in this case, which Brinkema swiftly refused as an argument. The judge urged both sides to mediate, stressing that coming to a compromise solution would be cost-effective and more efficient than running a weeks-long trial.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=US+Asks+Judge+To+Break+Up+Google's+Ad+Tech+Business%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2243229%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2243229%2Fus-asks-judge-to-break-up-googles-ad-tech-business%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2243229/us-asks-judge-to-break-up-googles-ad-tech-business?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681867&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1746228000	Temu To Stop Selling Goods From China Directly To US Customers	https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2121218/temu-to-stop-selling-goods-from-china-directly-to-us-customers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader quotes a report from the BBC: Temu has said it will stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform. The online marketplace said sales would now be handled by "locally based sellers," with orders fulfilled from within the country. The move comes as a duty-free rule for low-value packages is closed.\n \nTemu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called "de minimis" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes. Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform. "All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country. "The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses," it added.\n \nSupporters of the de minimis loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800, argue it helped streamline the customs process. But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs. In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole but the suspension was quickly paused as delivery services and customs agencies struggled to adjust. During the pause, the U.S. Postal Service even stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Temu+To+Stop+Selling+Goods+From+China+Directly+To+US+Customers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2121218%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2121218%2Ftemu-to-stop-selling-goods-from-china-directly-to-us-customers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2121218/temu-to-stop-selling-goods-from-china-directly-to-us-customers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681793&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD

The Verge reports: The r/Pinterest subreddit is also currently dominated by posts from confused users who claim their accounts have been suspended without evidence explaining how they violated the platform's guidelines. Users are also reporting they're experiencing an unusually high quantity of pins being deleted by Pinterest with absurd explanations, such as quilting magazines, cross-stitch art, and Minecraft bunk bed builds all being flagged for "adult content."\n \n"We hear your concerns about recent account deactivations on Pinterest," the company said on X. "To ensure Pinterest remains a safe and positive platform, we continuously monitor for content that violates our Community Guidelines and accounts with violative content may be deactivated as a result." "Pinterest has long-established, public Community Guidelines that clearly outline what is and isn't allowed on the platform," Pinterest spokesperson Ivy Choi said in a statement to The Verge. "We're committed to building a safer and more positive platform, and enforce these policies rigorously and continuously.

Ireland's Data Protection Commission also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users about where their personal data was being sent and ordered the company to comply with the rules within six months.\n \nThe Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok's lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company's European headquarters is based in Dublin. "TikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU," Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement. The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address "potential access by Chinese authorities" to European users' personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counterespionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as "materially diverging" from EU standards. Grahn said TikTok has "has never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them."\n \n[...] The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikTok's privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved "remote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China." TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information throughout the inquiry by saying that it didn't store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasn't until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers. TikTok disagrees with the decision and plans to appeal. The company said the decision focuses on a "select period" ending in May 2023, before it embarked on a data localization project called Project Clover that involved building three data centers in Europe.\n \n"The facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm," said Christine Grahn, TikTok's European head of public policy and government relations. "The decision fails to fully consider these considerable data security measures."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Irish+Privacy+Watchdog+Fines+TikTok+%24600+Million+For+China+Data+Transfers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2032203%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F2032203%2Firish-privacy-watchdog-fines-tiktok-600-million-for-china-data-transfers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/2032203/irish-privacy-watchdog-fines-tiktok-600-million-for-china-data-transfers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681723&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1746218700	Eric Schmidt Apparently Bought Relativity Space To Put Data Centers in Orbit	https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/1839250/eric-schmidt-apparently-bought-relativity-space-to-put-data-centers-in-orbit?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader shares a report: In the nearly two months since former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt acquired Relativity Space, the billionaire has not said much publicly about his plans for the launch company. However, his intentions for Relativity now appear to be increasingly clear: He wants to have the capability to launch a significant amount of computing infrastructure into space. \n\nWe know this because Schmidt appeared before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce during a hearing in April, speaking on the future of AI and US competitiveness. Among the topics raised then was the need for more electricity -- both renewable and non-renewable -- to power data centers that will facilitate the computing needs for AI development and applications. Schmidt noted that an average nuclear power plant in the United States generates 1 gigawatt of power. \n\n"People are planning 10 gigawatt data centers," Schmidt said. "Gives you a sense of how big this crisis is. Many people think that the energy demand for our industry will go from 3 percent to 99 percent of total generation. One of the estimates that I think is most likely is that data centers will require an additional 29 gigawatts of power by 2027, and 67 more gigawatts by 2030. These things are industrial at a scale that I have never seen in my life."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Eric+Schmidt+Apparently+Bought+Relativity+Space+To+Put+Data+Centers+in+Orbit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F1839250%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F1839250%2Feric-schmidt-apparently-bought-relativity-space-to-put-data-centers-in-orbit%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/1839250/eric-schmidt-apparently-bought-relativity-space-to-put-data-centers-in-orbit?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681653&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash

The Guardian: The soaring values of virtual currencies such as bitcoin after Donald Trump's election have put pressure on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to take a tougher line while it also lays the groundwork for the industry to flourish in the UK. \n\nAccording to a recent YouGov survey, the proportion of people in the UK using borrowed funds to make crypto purchases more than doubled from 6% in 2022 to 14% last year. Borrowing to fund investments, when asset values could change dramatically, meant consumers risked losing their entire investment and potentially other assets, such as their home. These characteristics closely resembled gambling, the Treasury committee found.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=UK+Preparing+To+Ban+Consumers+From+Buying+Crypto+With+Borrowed+Funds%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F1832253%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F1832253%2Fuk-preparing-to-ban-consumers-from-buying-crypto-with-borrowed-funds%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/1832253/uk-preparing-to-ban-consumers-from-buying-crypto-with-borrowed-funds?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681649&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash

Created by British company Genus, these pigs have had their DNA modified to remove the receptor that the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus uses to enter cells, rendering them immune to 99% of known virus variants. \n\nPRRS causes losses of approximately $300 million annually in the US alone by killing piglets and spreading rapidly through factory farms. According to Matt Culbertson, chief operating officer of Genus subsidiary Pig Improvement Company, the gene-edited pork could reach US markets sometime next year.

1746206400	Scientists Discover Massive Molecular Cloud Close To Earth	https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/0515209/scientists-discover-massive-molecular-cloud-close-to-earth?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An invisible molecular cloud that could shed light on how stars and planets form has been detected surprisingly close to Earth. From a report: Named Eos after the Greek goddess of the dawn, the cloud of gas would appear huge in the night sky if visible to the naked eye. It measures roughly 40 moons in width and has a weight about 3,400 times the mass of the sun, researchers reported in a study published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy. \n\n"In astronomy, seeing the previously unseen usually means peering deeper with ever more sensitive telescopes -- detecting those smaller planets ... those more distant galaxies," said study coauthor Thomas Haworth, an astrophysicist at Queen Mary University of London. "This thing was pretty much in our cosmic backyard, and we've just missed it," he added. Molecular clouds are composed of gas and dust from which hydrogen and carbon monoxide molecules can form. Dense clumps within these clouds can collapse to form young stars. The article clarifies that Eos is 300 light-years away, which to be sure, is closer than any of the molecular clouds that we've known about previously.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Scientists+Discover+Massive+Molecular+Cloud+Close+To+Earth%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F0515209%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F02%2F0515209%2Fscientists-discover-massive-molecular-cloud-close-to-earth%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/05/02/0515209/scientists-discover-massive-molecular-cloud-close-to-earth?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23681093&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1746043260	New Atomic Fountain Clock Joins Elite Group That Keeps the World on Time	https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/30/201234/new-atomic-fountain-clock-joins-elite-group-that-keeps-the-world-on-time?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	NIST: Clocks on Earth are ticking a bit more regularly thanks to NIST-F4, a new atomic clock at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) campus in Boulder, Colorado. This month, NIST researchers published a journal article establishing NIST-F4 as one of the world's most accurate timekeepers. NIST has also submitted the clock for acceptance as a primary frequency standard by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), the body that oversees the world's time. \n\nNIST-F4 measures an unchanging frequency in the heart of cesium atoms, the internationally agreed-upon basis for defining the second since 1967. The clock is based on a "fountain" design that represents the gold standard of accuracy in timekeeping. NIST-F4 ticks at such a steady rate that if it had started running 100 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed, it would be off by less than a second today. \n\nBy joining a small group of similarly elite time pieces run by just 10 countries around the world, NIST-F4 makes the foundation of global time more stable and secure. At the same time, it is helping to steer the clocks NIST uses to keep official U.S. time. Distributed via radio and the internet, official U.S. time is critical for telecommunications and transportation systems, financial trading platforms, data center operations and more.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=New+Atomic+Fountain+Clock+Joins+Elite+Group+That+Keeps+the+World+on+Time%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F30%2F201234%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F30%2F201234%2Fnew-atomic-fountain-clock-joins-elite-group-that-keeps-the-world-on-time%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/30/201234/new-atomic-fountain-clock-joins-elite-group-that-keeps-the-world-on-time?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23679731&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash

1746031860	Finland Restricts Use of Mobile Phones During School Day	https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/30/1651213/finland-restricts-use-of-mobile-phones-during-school-day?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Finland has passed legislation to restrict the use of phones and other mobile devices during the school day amid fears over their impact on student wellbeing and learning. From a report: Under the changes, which were approved by the Finnish parliament on Tuesday and will come into effect on 1 August, mobile devices will be heavily restricted during lesson times.

Earlier this year, Denmark said it would ban mobile phones from all schools. The chair of the country's wellbeing commission, Rasmus Meyer, told the Guardian the measure was necessary to stop schools from being "colonised by digital platforms" and urged the rest of Europe to follow suit.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Finland+Restricts+Use+of+Mobile+Phones+During+School+Day%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F30%2F1651213%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F30%2F1651213%2Ffinland-restricts-use-of-mobile-phones-during-school-day%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/30/1651213/finland-restricts-use-of-mobile-phones-during-school-day?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23679531&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash

From a report: If Google were required to share both its search data and the information on how it ranks results, rivals could reverse engineer "every aspect of our technology," Pichai testified on Wednesday. \n\n"The proposal on data sharing is so far reaching, so extraordinary," Pichai said. It "feels like de facto divestiture of search" and its entire intellectual property and technology over 25 years of research, he said. During testimony in federal court in Washington, Pichai asserted that a package of antitrust remedies proposed by the government is too extreme and will undermine Google's ability to compete in the market.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Google's+Sundar+Pichai+Calls+US+Remedies+'De+Facto'+Spinoff+of+Search%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F30%2F1540245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F30%2F1540245%2Fgoogles-sundar-pichai-calls-us-remedies-de-facto-spinoff-of-search%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/30/1540245/googles-sundar-pichai-calls-us-remedies-de-facto-spinoff-of-search?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23679467&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash

1746018000	Gen AI Is Not Replacing Jobs Or Hurting Wages At All, Say Economists	https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2341207/gen-ai-is-not-replacing-jobs-or-hurting-wages-at-all-say-economists?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Register: Instead of depressing wages or taking jobs, generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini have had almost no wage or labor impact so far -- a finding that calls into question the huge capital expenditures required to create and run AI models. In a working paper released earlier this month, economists Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard looked at the labor market impact of AI chatbots on 11 occupations, covering 25,000 workers and 7,000 workplaces in Denmark in 2023 and 2024.\n \nMany of these occupations have been described as being vulnerable to AI: accountants, customer support specialists, financial advisors, HR professionals, IT support specialists, journalists, legal professionals, marketing professionals, office clerks, software developers, and teachers. Yet after Humlum, assistant professor of economics at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, and Vestergaard, a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen, analyzed the data, they found the labor and wage impact of chatbots to be minimal. "AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation," the authors state in their paper.\n \nThe report should concern the tech industry, which has hyped AI's economic potential while plowing billions into infrastructure meant to support it. Early this year, OpenAI admitted that it loses money per query even on its most expensive enterprise SKU, while companies like Microsoft and Amazon are starting to pull back on their AI infrastructure spending in light of low business adoption past a few pilots. The problem isn't that workers are avoiding generative AI chatbots -- quite the contrary. But they simply aren't yet equating to actual economic benefits. "The adoption of these chatbots has been remarkably fast," Humlum told The Register. "Most workers in the exposed occupations have now adopted these chatbots. Employers are also shifting gears and actively encouraging it. But then when we look at the economic outcomes, it really has not moved the needle."\n \nHumlum said while there are gains and time savings to be had, "there's definitely a question of who they really accrue to. And some of it could be the firms -- we cannot directly look at firm profitability. Some of it could also just be that you save some time on existing tasks, but you're not really able to expand your output and therefore earn more. So it's like it saves you time writing emails. But if you cannot really take on more work or do something else that is really valuable, then that will put a damper on how much we should actually expect those time savings to affect your earning ability, your total hours, your wages."\n \n"In terms of economic outcomes, when we're looking at hard metrics -- in the administrative labor market data on earnings, wages -- these tools have really not made a difference so far," said Humlum. "So I think that that puts in some sense an upper bound on what return we should expect from these tools, at least in the short run. My general conclusion is that any story that you want to tell about these tools being very transformative, needs to contend with the fact that at least two years after [the introduction of AI chatbots], they've not made a difference for economic outcomes."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Gen+AI+Is+Not+Replacing+Jobs+Or+Hurting+Wages+At+All%2C+Say+Economists%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2341207%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2341207%2Fgen-ai-is-not-replacing-jobs-or-hurting-wages-at-all-say-economists%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2341207/gen-ai-is-not-replacing-jobs-or-hurting-wages-at-all-say-economists?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678927&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1746007200	Firefly Aerospace's Alpha Rocket Fails, Sends Satellite Falling Into Ocean	https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2350236/firefly-aerospaces-alpha-rocket-fails-sends-satellite-falling-into-ocean?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Firefly Aerospace's sixth Alpha rocket launch failed on April 29, 2025, after an upper-stage anomaly prevented a Lockheed Martin satellite demo from reaching orbit. Both the stage and payload fell into the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica. Space.com reports: The two-stage, 96.7-foot-tall (29.6 meters) Alpha lifted off from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base this morning (April 29), carrying a technology demonstration for aerospace giant Lockheed Martin toward low Earth orbit (LEO). But the payload never got there. Alpha suffered an anomaly shortly after its two stages separated, which led to the loss of the nozzle extension for the upper stage's single Lightning engine. This significantly reduced the engine's thrust, dooming the mission, Firefly said in an update several hours after launch.\n \nToday's mission, which Firefly called "Message in a Booster," was the first of up to 25 that the company will conduct for Lockheed Martin over the next five years. The flight aimed to send a satellite technology demonstrator to LEO. This demo payload "was specifically built to showcase the company's pathfinding efforts for its LM 400 mid-sized, multi-mission satellite bus, and to demonstrate the space vehicle's operational capabilities on orbit for potential customers," Firefly wrote in a prelaunch mission description. "Initial indications showed Alpha's upper stage reached 320 km [199 miles] in altitude. However, upon further assessment, the team learned the upper stage did not reach orbital velocity, and the stage and payload have now safely impacted the Pacific Ocean in a cleared zone north of Antarctica," an update reads.\n \n"Firefly recognizes the hard work that went into payload development and would like to thank our mission partners at Lockheed Martin for their continued support," it continues. "The team is working closely with our customers and the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] to conduct an investigation and determine root cause of the anomaly. We will provide more information on our mission page after the investigation is completed."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Firefly+Aerospace's+Alpha+Rocket+Fails%2C+Sends+Satellite+Falling+Into+Ocean%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2350236%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2350236%2Ffirefly-aerospaces-alpha-rocket-fails-sends-satellite-falling-into-ocean%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2350236/firefly-aerospaces-alpha-rocket-fails-sends-satellite-falling-into-ocean?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678929&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1745996400	After 53 Years, a Failed Soviet Venus Spacecraft Is Crashing Back to Earth	https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2321232/after-53-years-a-failed-soviet-venus-spacecraft-is-crashing-back-to-earth?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Kosmos 482, a failed Soviet Venus probe, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry in mid-May after orbiting Earth for 53 years. Gizmodo reports: The lander module from an old Soviet spacecraft is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere during the second week of May, according to Marco Langbroek, a satellite tracker based in Leiden, the Netherlands. "As this is a lander that was designed to survive passage through the Venus atmosphere, it is possible that it will survive reentry through the Earth atmosphere intact, and impact intact," Langbroek wrote in a blog update. "The risks involved are not particularly high, but not zero."\n \nKosmos 482 launched on March 31, 1972 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport in Kazakhstan. The mission was an attempt by the Soviet space program to reach Venus, but it failed to gain enough velocity to enter a transfer trajectory toward the scorching-hot planet. A malfunction resulted in an engine burn that wasn't sufficient to reach Venus' orbit and left the spacecraft in an elliptical Earth orbit, according to NASA. The spacecraft broke apart into four different pieces, with two of the smaller fragments reentering over Ashburton, New Zealand, two days after launch. Meanwhile, two remaining pieces, believed to be the payload and the detached upper-stage engine unit, entered a higher orbit measuring 130 by 6,089 miles (210 by 9,800 kilometers).\n \nThe failed mission consisted of a carrier bus and a lander probe, which together form a spherical pressure vessel weighing more than 1,000 pounds (495 kilograms). Considering its mass, "risks are similar to that of a meteorite impact," Langbroek wrote. As of now, it's hard to determine exactly when the spacecraft will reenter. Langbroek estimates that the reentry will take place on May 10, but a more precise date will get clearer as the reentry date nears.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=After+53+Years%2C+a+Failed+Soviet+Venus+Spacecraft+Is+Crashing+Back+to+Earth%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2321232%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2321232%2Fafter-53-years-a-failed-soviet-venus-spacecraft-is-crashing-back-to-earth%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2321232/after-53-years-a-failed-soviet-venus-spacecraft-is-crashing-back-to-earth?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678905&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1745983800	Chemical In Plastics Linked To 350,000 Heart Disease Deaths	https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/238206/chemical-in-plastics-linked-to-350000-heart-disease-deaths?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Hill: Daily exposure to certain chemicals used to manufacture household plastics may be connected to more than 356,000 cardiovascular-related deaths in 2018 alone, a new analysis has found. These chemicals, called phthalates, are present in products around the world but have particular popularity in the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific -- regions that collectively bore about 75 percent of the global death total, according to the research, published on Tuesday in the Lancet eBioMedicine.\n \nPhthalates, often used in personal care products, children's toys and food packaging and processing materials, are known to disrupt hormone function and have been linked to birth defects, infertility, learning disabilities and neurological disorders. The NYU Langone Health team focused in the analysis on a kind of phthalate called di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), which is used to make items like food containers and medical equipment softer and more flexible. Scientists have already shown that exposure to DEHP can trigger an overactive immune response in the heart's arteries, which over time can be linked to increased risk of heart attack or stroke.\n \nIn the new analysis, the researchers estimated that DEHP exposure played a role in 356,238 global deaths in 2018, or nearly 13.5 percent of heart disease mortality among men and women ages 55 through 64. [...] These findings are in line with the team's previous research, which in 2021 determined that phthalates were connected to more than 50,000 premature deaths each year among older Americans -- most of whom succumbed to heart conditions. But this latest analysis is likely the first global estimate of cardiovascular mortality resulting from exposure to these environmental contaminants [...]. In a separate report from the New York Times, author Nina Agrawal highlights some of the caveats with the data.\n \nFirst of all, the study relies heavily on statistical modeling and assumptions, drawing from prior research that may include biases and confounding factors like diet or socioeconomic status. It also uses U.S.-based risk estimates that may not generalize globally and focuses only on one type of phthalate (DEHP). Additionally, as Agrawal points out, this is an observational study, showing correlation rather than causation. As such, more direct, long-term research is needed to clarify the true health impact of phthalate exposure.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Chemical+In+Plastics+Linked+To+350%2C000+Heart+Disease+Deaths%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F238206%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F238206%2Fchemical-in-plastics-linked-to-350000-heart-disease-deaths%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/238206/chemical-in-plastics-linked-to-350000-heart-disease-deaths?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678895&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1745974200	Google Play Sees 47% Decline In Apps Since Start of Last Year	https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2256200/google-play-sees-47-decline-in-apps-since-start-of-last-year?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Google Play's app marketplace has seen a dramatic 47% drop in available apps\n -- from 3.4 million to 1.8 million -- since the start of 2024. An analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures attributes the decline to stricter quality standards, expanded human reviews, and increased enforcement against low-quality and deceptive apps. TechCrunch reports: In July 2024, Google announced it would raise the minimum quality requirements for apps, which may have impacted the number of available Play Store app listings.\n \nInstead of only banning broken apps that crashed, wouldn't install, or run properly, the company said it would begin banning apps that demonstrated "limited functionality and content." That included static apps without app-specific features, such as text-only apps or PDF file apps. It also included apps that provided little content, like those that only offered a single wallpaper. Additionally, Google banned apps that were designed to do nothing or have no function, which may have been tests or other abandoned developer efforts.\n \nReached for comment, Google confirmed that its new policies were factors here, which also included an expanded set of verification requirements, required app testing for new personal developer accounts, and expanded human reviews to check for apps that try to deceive or defraud users. In addition, the company pointed to other 2024 investments in AI for threat detection, stronger privacy policies, improved developer tools, and more. As a result, Google prevented 2.36 million policy-violating apps from being published on its Play Store and banned more than 158,000 developer accounts that had attempted to publish harmful apps, it said. TechCrunch also notes that a new trader status rule, which went into effect in the EU this February, could be another contributing factor. It requires developers to display their names and addresses in their app listings, and failure to comply would see their apps removed from EU app stores.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Google+Play+Sees+47%25+Decline+In+Apps+Since+Start+of+Last+Year%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2256200%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2256200%2Fgoogle-play-sees-47-decline-in-apps-since-start-of-last-year%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2256200/google-play-sees-47-decline-in-apps-since-start-of-last-year?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678891&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1745971800	Intel Says It's Rolling Out Laptop GPU Drivers With 10% To 25% Better Performance	https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2247217/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Ars Technica's Andrew Cunningham reports: Intel's oddball Core Ultra 200V laptop chips -- codenamed Lunar Lake -- will apparently be a one-off experiment, not to be replicated in future Intel laptop chips. They're Intel's only processors with memory integrated onto the CPU package; the only ones with a neural processing unit that meets Microsoft's Copilot+ performance requirements; and the only ones with Intel's best-performing integrated GPUs, the Intel Arc 130V and 140V.\n \nToday, Intel announced some updates to its graphics driver that specifically benefit those integrated GPUs, welcome news for anyone who bought one and is trying to get by with it as an entry-level gaming system. Intel says that version 32.0.101.6734 of its graphics driver can speed up average frame rates in some games by around 10 percent, and can speed up "1 percent low FPS" (that is, for any given frames per second measurement, whatever your frame rate is the slowest 1 percent of the time) by as much as 25 percent. This should, in theory, make games run better in general and ease some of the stuttering you notice when your game's performance dips down to that 1 percent level.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Intel+Says+It's+Rolling+Out+Laptop+GPU+Drivers+With+10%25+To+25%25+Better+Performance%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2247217%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2247217%2Fintel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2247217/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678869&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1745969400	New York Lawmakers Reach Deal On 'Bell-To-Bell' School Cellphone Ban	https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2023245/new-york-lawmakers-reach-deal-on-bell-to-bell-school-cellphone-ban?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader quotes a report from CBS News: New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says a $254 billion state budget deal has been reached, including a "bell-to-bell" school cellphone ban. [...] The distraction-free policy would take effect next school year, making New York the largest state in the country with a "bell-to-bell" cellphone ban. Hochul says the plan will help protect children from addictive technology and improve their mental health. The New York State United Teachers union also came out in support of the ban, saying "we are at a crisis point."\n \nThe governor previously outlined the proposal back in January, saying it would ban the use of smartphones and other internet-enabled devices on school grounds during the school day. That includes classroom time, lunch and study hall periods. "A bell-to-bell ban, morning until the day is over, is not going to hurt your kids. It's going to help them emerge with stronger mental health and resiliency," she told CBS News New York at the time.\n \nHochul said the ban would include smartphones and other personal "smart" devices, like smartwatches. Exemptions could be made if a student requires a device to manage a medical condition or for translation purposes. Cellphones that don't have internet capability and devices that are provided by the school for lesson plans would still be allowed. The proposal would let individual schools come up with their own ways to implement the ban and store the devices, and schools would be able to decide whether to have students leave them in things like pouches, lockers or cubbies. It would also require schools to make sure parents have a way to contact their children during the day, if needed. "Protecting our communities requires more than streets where people feel safe. We need classrooms where young minds can flourish, and that means eliminating once and for all the digital distractions that steal our kids' attention," the governor said, adding, "We protected our kids before from cigarettes, alcohol and drunk driving, and now, we're protecting them from addictive technology designed to hijack their attention."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=New+York+Lawmakers+Reach+Deal+On+'Bell-To-Bell'+School+Cellphone+Ban%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2023245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F2023245%2Fnew-york-lawmakers-reach-deal-on-bell-to-bell-school-cellphone-ban%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/2023245/new-york-lawmakers-reach-deal-on-bell-to-bell-school-cellphone-ban?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678741&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD

If you're still using an smartphone, you'll want to install any remaining updates before that date, as no future updates will be available afterward. 9to5Google reports: When LG called it quits for Android smartphones, the company also committed to a few more updates. That included an Android 12 update for select devices, the last major update the company would put out, as well as security updates for at least three years after each device had been released. That three-year cutoff has long since passed for all LG devices, but any devices still floating around out there will soon no longer be able to pull updates.

IGN reports: IGN understands that these wider cuts largely impacted EA's Experiences team, which includes groups such as EA's Fan Care team and various others working on customer support and marketing, though other EA departments saw reductions as well. As with other cuts at EA, those impacted will be given the opportunity to apply for other roles internally prior to being let go.\n \nThe roughly 100 jobs impacted at Respawn included individuals in development, publishing, and QA workers on Apex Legends, as well as smaller groups of individuals working on the Jedi team and two canceled incubation projects, one of which we reported on back in March, and the other of which was, per Bloomberg's reporting, a new Titanfall game. "As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth," an EA spokesperson said in an official statement.

Researchers analyzed 576,000 code samples from 16 popular large language models and found 19.7% of package dependencies -- 440,445 in total -- were "hallucinated." \n\nThese non-existent dependencies exacerbate dependency confusion attacks, where malicious packages with identical names to legitimate ones can infiltrate software. Open source models hallucinated at nearly 22%, compared to 5% for commercial models. "Once the attacker publishes a package under the hallucinated name, containing some malicious code, they rely on the model suggesting that name to unsuspecting users," said lead researcher Joseph Spracklen. Alarmingly, 43% of hallucinations repeated across multiple queries, making them predictable targets.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=AI-Generated+Code+Creates+Major+Security+Risk+Through+'Package+Hallucinations'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1837239%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1837239%2Fai-generated-code-creates-major-security-risk-through-package-hallucinations%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1837239/ai-generated-code-creates-major-security-risk-through-package-hallucinations?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678649&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects a need for 10 billion metric tons of carbon removals annually by 2050, yet only 175 million tons have been sold to date -- less than 2% of requirements. \n\nMicrosoft dominates the market, accounting for 35% of all purchases and 76% of engineered removal solutions specifically. The market suffers from significant barriers: unproven technologies, vast price disparities ($80 per ton for forest projects versus $1,000 for direct air capture), and lack of standardization.

1745947800	India Court Orders Proton Mail Block On Security Grounds	https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1730240/india-court-orders-proton-mail-block-on-security-grounds?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday directed India's government to block Switzerland-based email service Proton Mail, citing national security concerns and law enforcement challenges. Justice M Nagaprasanna ordered authorities to initiate proceedings under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act to ban the service, while mandating immediate blocking of "offending URLs" until final decisions are made. \n\nThe ruling followed a petition from M Moser Design Associates India, which claimed its female employees were targeted with obscene emails containing "AI-generated deepfake images" sent via Proton Mail. Petitioners argued Proton Mail operates servers outside India, making it inaccessible to law enforcement. The court noted several bomb threats to Indian schools were sent using the service, which has already been banned in Russia and Saudi Arabia. Additional Solicitor General Aravind Kamath, representing the government, said authorities would comply with the court's direction.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=India+Court+Orders+Proton+Mail+Block+On+Security+Grounds%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1730240%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1730240%2Findia-court-orders-proton-mail-block-on-security-grounds%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1730240/india-court-orders-proton-mail-block-on-security-grounds?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678577&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1745944860	Bitcoin Mining Costs Surge Beyond Profitability Threshold	https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1614226/bitcoin-mining-costs-surge-beyond-profitability-threshold?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Bitcoin mining has crossed a critical economic threshold, with costs now exceeding market value for most operators. According to data cited by CoinShares, large public mining companies spend over $82,000 to produce a single Bitcoin -- nearly double last quarter's figure -- while smaller operations face even steeper costs of approximately $137,000 per coin. \n\nWith Bitcoin currently trading around $94,703, the math no longer works for most miners. The economics become particularly challenging in high-electricity-cost regions like Germany, where mining a single coin requires approximately $200,000. Industry analysts suggest larger mining operations are adapting by optimizing energy consumption and positioning their computational infrastructure for alternative uses. These companies can potentially lease their mining setups for other computational tasks during unprofitable mining periods, then resume mining when market conditions improve. \n\nFor individual miners, however, the era of profitable home operations appears effectively over, as industrial-scale facilities with strategic positioning and optimized technology have fundamentally altered the mining landscape.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Bitcoin+Mining+Costs+Surge+Beyond+Profitability+Threshold%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1614226%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1614226%2Fbitcoin-mining-costs-surge-beyond-profitability-threshold%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1614226/bitcoin-mining-costs-surge-beyond-profitability-threshold?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678541&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1745942460	Reddit Issuing 'Formal Legal Demands' Against Researchers Who Conducted Secret AI Experiment on Users	https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1556234/reddit-issuing-formal-legal-demands-against-researchers-who-conducted-secret-ai-experiment-on-users?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader shares a report: Reddit's top lawyer, Ben Lee, said the company is considering legal action against researchers from the University of Zurich who ran what he called an "improper and highly unethical experiment" by surreptitiously deploying AI chatbots in a popular debate subreddit. The University of Zurich told 404 Media that the experiment results will not be published and said the university is investigating how the research was conducted. \n\nAs we reported Monday, researchers at the University of Zurich ran an "unauthorized" and secret experiment on Reddit users in the r/changemyview subreddit in which dozens of AI bots engaged in debates with users about controversial issues. In some cases, the bots generated responses which claimed they were rape survivors, worked with trauma patients, or were Black people who were opposed to the Black Lives Matter movement. The researchers used a separate AI to mine the posting history of the people they were responding to in an attempt to determine personal details about them that they believed would make their bots more effective, such as their age, race, gender, location, and political beliefs.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Reddit+Issuing+'Formal+Legal+Demands'+Against+Researchers+Who+Conducted+Secret+AI+Experiment+on+Users%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1556234%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1556234%2Freddit-issuing-formal-legal-demands-against-researchers-who-conducted-secret-ai-experiment-on-users%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1556234/reddit-issuing-formal-legal-demands-against-researchers-who-conducted-secret-ai-experiment-on-users?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678523&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash

From a report: Google's report said that the number of zero-day exploits -- referring to security flaws that were unknown to the software makers at the time hackers abused them -- had dropped from 98 exploits in 2023 to 75 exploits in 2024. \n\nBut the report noted that of the proportion of zero-days that Google could attribute -- meaning identifying the hackers who were responsible for exploiting them -- at least 23 zero-day exploits were linked to government-backed hackers. Among those 23 exploits, 10 zero-days were attributed to hackers working directly for governments, including five exploits linked to China and another five to North Korea.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Government+Hackers+Are+Leading+the+Use+of+Attributed+Zero-Days%2C+Google+Says%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1525220%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1525220%2Fgovernment-hackers-are-leading-the-use-of-attributed-zero-days-google-says%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1525220/government-hackers-are-leading-the-use-of-attributed-zero-days-google-says?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678481&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1745937900	Fired Disney Employee Gets 3 Years in Prison For Hacking and Changing Menus	https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1445247/fired-disney-employee-gets-3-years-in-prison-for-hacking-and-changing-menus?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	A former Disney employee who hacked into the company's servers to alter its restaurant menus, including falsifying allergen information and printing profane language, has been sentenced to three years in prison. From a report: Michael Scheuer, a Florida resident, was sentenced last week in federal court and ordered to pay nearly $690,000 in restitution, with most of that going to Disney. He pled guilty in January to one count of computer fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. \n\n"Scheuer remains remorseful and apologetic to his former co-workers. We are grateful that the judge heard all of our arguments and mitigation when fashioning a sentence that was half of what the government was seeking," said David Haas, Scheuer's lawyer, in a statement to CNN. \n\nScheuer worked as a menu production manager for Disney and was fired last June for misconduct, according to the original complaint. He had access to, and also used, secure internal servers for creating and publishing menus for all of Disney's restaurants as part of his job at the company.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Fired+Disney+Employee+Gets+3+Years+in+Prison+For+Hacking+and+Changing+Menus%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1445247%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1445247%2Ffired-disney-employee-gets-3-years-in-prison-for-hacking-and-changing-menus%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1445247/fired-disney-employee-gets-3-years-in-prison-for-hacking-and-changing-menus?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678441&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1745935200	Amazon To Display Tariff Costs For Consumers, Report Says	https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1031207/amazon-to-display-tariff-costs-for-consumers-report-says?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader shares a report: Amazon doesn't want to shoulder the blame for the cost of President Donald Trump's trade war. \n\nSo the e-commerce giant will soon show how much Trump's tariffs are adding to the price of each product, according to a person familiar with the plan. \n\nThe shopping site will display how much of an item's cost is derived from tariffs -- right next to the product's total listed price. In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: This is hostile and political act by Amazon. Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years? Update: Amazon is considering showing a tariff surcharge on items sold via its site for ultra-low-price items, called Haul, the company said. "This was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties," the company added.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Amazon+To+Display+Tariff+Costs+For+Consumers%2C+Report+Says%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1031207%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F1031207%2Famazon-to-display-tariff-costs-for-consumers-report-says%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/1031207/amazon-to-display-tariff-costs-for-consumers-report-says?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678223&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash

1745920800	OpenAI-Microsoft Alliance Fractures as AI Titans Chart Separate Paths	https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/0445225/openai-microsoft-alliance-fractures-as-ai-titans-chart-separate-paths?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	The once-celebrated partnership between OpenAI's Sam Altman and Microsoft's Satya Nadella is deteriorating amid fundamental disagreements over computing resources, model access, and AI capabilities, according to WSJ. The relationship that Altman once called "the best partnership in tech" has grown strained as both companies prepare for independent futures. \n\nTensions center on several critical areas: Microsoft's provision of computing power, OpenAI's willingness to share model access, and conflicting views on achieving humanlike intelligence. Altman has expressed confidence OpenAI can build models with humanlike intelligence soon -- a milestone Nadella publicly dismissed as "nonsensical benchmark hacking" during a February podcast. \n\nThe companies retain significant leverage over each other. Microsoft can block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit entity, potentially costing the startup billions if not completed this year. Meanwhile, OpenAI's board can trigger contract clauses preventing Microsoft from accessing its most advanced technology. \n\nAfter Altman's brief ouster in 2023 -- dubbed "the blip" within OpenAI -- Nadella pursued an "insurance policy" by hiring DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman for $650 million to develop competing models. The personal relationship has also cooled, with the executives now communicating primarily through scheduled weekly calls rather than frequent text exchanges.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=OpenAI-Microsoft+Alliance+Fractures+as+AI+Titans+Chart+Separate+Paths%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F0445225%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F0445225%2Fopenai-microsoft-alliance-fractures-as-ai-titans-chart-separate-paths%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/0445225/openai-microsoft-alliance-fractures-as-ai-titans-chart-separate-paths?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678071&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1745910000	Amazon Launches First Kuiper Internet Satellites	https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/0435203/amazon-launches-first-kuiper-internet-satellites?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Amazon successfully launched the first 27 satellites for its Project Kuiper internet constellation, kicking off a major effort to compete with Starlink by deploying over 1,600 satellites by mid-2026. It company is investing $10 billion in Kuiper and plans to begin commercial service later this year. CNBC reports: "We had a nice smooth countdown, beautiful weather, beautiful liftoff, and Atlas V is on its way to orbit to take those 27 Kuiper satellites, put them on their way and really start this new era in internet connectivity," Caleb Weiss, a systems engineer at ULA, said on the livestream following the launch.\n \nThe satellites are expected to separate from the rocket roughly 280 miles above Earth's surface, at which point Amazon will look to confirm the satellites can independently maneuver and communicate with its employees on the ground. [...] In his shareholder letter earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Kuiper will require upfront investment at first, but eventually the company expects it to be "a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us." ROIC stands for return on invested capital. Investors will be listening for any commentary around further capex spend on Kuiper when Amazon reports first-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday. \nA livestream can be found here.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Amazon+Launches+First+Kuiper+Internet+Satellites%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F0435203%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F29%2F0435203%2Famazon-launches-first-kuiper-internet-satellites%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/29/0435203/amazon-launches-first-kuiper-internet-satellites?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23678069&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD
